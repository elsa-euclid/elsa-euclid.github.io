ELSA website - to do list 

 * Work packages can edit / update their sections as convenient
 * Only an odd number of menu items work for some reason. To fix?
 * It will be useful to add News and Internal menu items when there 
   is enough content for them. 
 * The EU logo icon looks very small in mobile mode - fix?
 * FontAwesome package version used here doesn't have Bluesky or Threads 
   icons - update and fix so the contact tab can have a set of icons?

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
